- Trees are useful for modeling data that has a hierarchical relationship that moves in the direction from parent to child. No child node will have more than one parent.
- To recap some terms:
    - **`root`**: A node which has no parent. One per tree.
    - **`parent`**: A node which references other nodes.
    - **`child`**: Nodes referenced by other nodes.
    - **`sibling`**: Nodes which have the same parent.
    - **`leaf`**: Nodes which have no children.
    - **`level`**: The height or depth of the tree. Root nodes are at level 1, their children are at level 2, and so on.
- Each time we move from a parent to a child, we’re moving down a *level*. Depending on the orientation we refer to this as the *depth* (counting levels down from the root node) or *height* (counting levels up from a leaf node).
