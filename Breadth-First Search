- The breadth-first search is a tree traversal algorithm that follows a level-by-level search pattern, starting with the root node on top and moving to each level in search of a goal node.
- As nodes of a tree are searched, their children are added to a queue known as the frontier. This queue follows the first-in-first-out rule known as FIFO where the first nodes added to the queue will be the first to leave and be searched.

Level-By-Level Search
- The level-by-level pattern followed by the breadth-first search can feel very approachable since it is just like searching for a specific word in a book or even this article. 
- Every word is checked line by line with no word or line skipped. Similarly, the breadth-first search iteratively checks child nodes in the order they are placed in a queue.


The search starts with two values, a root node for the tree and the goal value we are searching for.
Our first search step is to add the root node to the end of our node queue. The queue represents the search’s frontier.
While the node queue contains at least one value, we retrieve the next node from the frontier and check its value against the goal value.
If the two values match, the current node is returned. If they don’t match, the search continues by adding the current node’s children to the frontier.
